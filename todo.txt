  - force layout
    - "clear" zoom/pan button
    - clear zoom/pan on window change
    - automatic inital zoom based on longest path length?

Planned:

      - add larger 'hitbox' for connection for tooltip

      - More stylized
        - graphics
        - More connected nodes are larger?
        - Connection width based on weight?
      - cleanup... the file's getting a bit messy
